                And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on a variation of shadows, heavy
                shadows against light shadows-it has nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese
                rooms, perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                Their reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows. Out
                beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or
                build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this
                indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. We do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad,
                fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose.
            </p>

        <div class="carousel2">
            <p class="text">
                The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room
                will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile
                beauty of the feeble light.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                We delight in the mere sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky
                wall, there to live out what little life remains to them.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament. And
                so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral
                color.
            </p>

                The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a
                difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
                And from these delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room take on a tinge
                peculiarly their own.
